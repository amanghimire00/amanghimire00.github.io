                    I am currently working in the College of Education as a Senior Student Associate. My daily tasks consist of
                    greeting other students, listening to their concerns as well as guiding them to the individuals that they are
                    looking for. Furthermore, I also assist our staff members with small tasks such as delivering packages, prining, copying and emailing.

                    During the summer of 2022, I completed an internship for UPS. The position that I was granted was a Financial Planning
                and Analysis position at the Accounts Payable tower. While my internship was remote, I went into the workplace several times 
                and got some hands-on experience. My daily tasks would consist of me checking out "AIMS" files
                which consisted of excel spreadsheets of checks that were to-be updated and reissued. I would have to utilize VLOOKUPS and cross 
                reference these checks with other checks that were to be distributed so that no duplicates would go through. I was also incharge of 
                trying to updating our database consisting of over 100,000 checks. Thankfully, my prior SQL knowledge and experience helped me succeed
                in this part of my internship. I also attended many supervisor and manager meetings, most of which initially made me rethink my choice of working at UPS as they
                sounded so sophisticated. However, as I began to learn more about the payable side of the company, I started to understand and recognize
                the topic at hand. Overall this internship really helped me apply my accouthing and databse knowledge in the real world and really helped me grow
                and learn from my mistakes.
